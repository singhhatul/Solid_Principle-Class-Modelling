SOLID PRINCIPLES TASKS:
1. Consider the design of the following class, Text that models an editor or editing text and
printing text.
class Text {
String text;
String author;
int length;
String getText() { ... }
void setText(String s) { ... }
String getAuthor() { ... }
void setAuthor(String s) { ... }
int getLength() { ... }
void setLength(int k) { ... }
/*methods that change the text*/
void allLettersToUpperCase() { ... }
void findSubTextAndDelete(String s) { ... }
/*method for formatting output*/
void printText() { ... }
}
2. Give your comments on the design of this class.
Consider an insurance system that validates health insurance claims before approving one. The
process is as follows:
A customer of the company files a claim
A health insurance surveyor validates a claim
A claim manager either approves or rejects the claim
3. Design the system with skeleton code.
You are developing a Java application that models a toy builder. Each toy will have a price and
color. Some toys, such as a toy car or toy train can additionally move, while some toys, such as
a toy plane can both move and fly.
4. Design the system with skeleton code.

Consider the scenario of an electric switch that turns a light bulb on or off.Model the requirement with skeleton code.
